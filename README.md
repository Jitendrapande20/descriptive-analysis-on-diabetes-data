Descriptive Analysis of Diabetes Data



Overview![diabetesdashbord](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8737dbdd-b9f3-4859-a37e-4e9c8d33142f)


This project performs a Descriptive Analysis on diabetes data, focusing on key health metrics such as age, glucose, BMI, insulin outcomes, pregnancy, and blood pressure. The analysis provides insights into the relationships between these variables and diabetes prevalence, a

iming to support better decision-making in healthcare.

Data Used

The dataset used in this analysis contains patient information with variables related to diabetes risk factors. Key variables include:

Age

Glucose levels

Body Mass Index (BMI)

Insulin outcomes

Pregnancy status

Blood Pressure levels


Key Insights

Below are the major insights derived from the descriptive analysis of the dataset:

1. Age:

Analysis reveals an increasing diabetes risk with age.

Elderly populations show higher glucose and insulin levels, increasing the likelihood of diabetes.



2. Glucose:

Elevated glucose levels are directly linked with higher diabetes prevalence.

Certain age and BMI groups show distinct glucose level patterns.



3. BMI:

Higher BMI correlates with increased insulin resistance and a greater likelihood of developing diabetes.

Individuals with BMI > 30 have a significantly higher risk.



4. Insulin Outcomes:

Variations in insulin outcomes help identify individuals with insulin resistance.

The analysis provides detailed outcomes for different glucose and BMI ranges.



5. Pregnancy:

Pregnancy is a significant risk factor for gestational diabetes.

A deeper dive into pregnancy-related data highlights increased glucose levels during pregnancy.



6. Blood Pressure:

Elevated blood pressure is closely associated with diabetes complications.

Individuals with both hypertension and high glucose levels exhibit a higher risk of diabetes.




Tools and Technologies Used

Power BI: For data visualization and interactive dashboards.

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn): For data cleaning, analysis, and statistical plotting.

Jupyter Notebook: For analysis documentation and presentation.
